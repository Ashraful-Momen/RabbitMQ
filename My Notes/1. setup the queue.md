# RabbitMQ Notes

## Queue Setup
------------------

### 1. Virtual Host
- **Description**: Select the virtual host for hosting.
- **Purpose**: Virtual hosts provide logical separation between different applications or environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

---

### 2. Type
- **Description**: Defines the type of queue based on its purpose and priority.
- **Options**:
  1. **Default Virtual Host**: 
     - By default, this option is selected.
     - Suitable for general-purpose use cases.
  2. **Quorum Queue**: 
     - Designed for high availability and durability.
     - Ideal for critical systems where data loss is unacceptable.
  3. **Classic Queue**: 
     - Traditional RabbitMQ queue type.
     - Suitable for most use cases but lacks some advanced features of quorum queues.
  4. **Streaming Queue**: 
     - Optimized for high-throughput, event-streaming scenarios.
     - Best suited for applications like real-time analytics or log processing.

---

### 3. Name
- **Description**: The name of the queue.
- **Best Practice**: Set the queue name as the **route key** if applicable.
- **Example**: `order_processing_queue`

---

### 4. Durability
- **Description**: Determines whether the queue and its messages persist after a broker restart.
- **Options**:
  1. **Durable**: 
     - Messages are stored permanently.
     - Survives broker restarts.
  2. **Transient**: 
     - Messages are stored temporarily.
     - Lost after a broker restart.

---

### 5. Arguments
- **Description**: Additional configuration options for fine-tuning the queue behavior.
- **Examples**:
  - `x-max-priority`: Sets the maximum priority level for a priority queue.
  - `x-message-ttl`: Defines the time-to-live (TTL) for messages in the queue.
  - `x-dead-letter-exchange`: Specifies an exchange to route dead-lettered messages.
  - `x-queue-mode`: Configures the queue mode (e.g., lazy mode for disk-based storage).
